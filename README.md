Demo Dartium Extension
======================

I took the code from the Chrome Demo Extension (http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html)
and replaced pretty much everything with dart.

I also kept the dart dummy code.

In Dartium I went to Settings > Extensions > Developer mode > Load unpacked extension

and I loaded the code to see if it works. It does ;-)
